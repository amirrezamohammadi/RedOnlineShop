Hello
It's Amirreza Mohammadi.

in this file I am going to provide some steps to how to run this project:

1. at first you should create a database called `OnlineShop`
   and then import the database (OnlineShop.sql) file into it.

2. open the `RedOnlineShop.sln` file with Microsoft Visual Studio.

3. you should change the connection string in 2 file:
   first: line 15 , appsettings.json in the main root of the project.

   second: go to Models/OnlineShopContext.cs and change the connection string here as well.

   note: `please a provide user for database with password.`
   note: `please do not use root user.`

4. run the project in Visual Studio.

# it will open a page in your browser.

# it may takes time to run the project.

# if the web page does not appear go to link below:

http://localhost:44403

# if you provide a valid email address you will receive email for orders and account creation.

Thank you.
